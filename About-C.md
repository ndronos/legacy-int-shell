About C
---


```
Throw out your old ideas about C and get to know a programming language
that has substantially outgrown its origins.
... up-to-date techniques missing from otherC tutorials,
whether you're new to the language or just getting reacquainted.

C isn't just the foundation of modern programming languages; it *is* a modern language,
ideal for writing efficient, state-of-the-art applications.

Get past idioms that made sense on mainframes
and learn the tools you need to work with this evolved and aggressively simple language. 

No matter what programming language you currently favor, you'll quickly see that 21st century C rocks.

The computer world has undergone a revolution since the publication of *The C Programming Language* in 1978.
During this time, C has changed too, although only modestly, and it has spread far beyound its origins
as the language of the UNIX operating system.

C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book.

(K&R, 1988)

C wears well as one's experience with it grows.

C is a general-purpose programming language...
C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized
to any particular area of application.
But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks
than more powerful languages.

C is not tied to any particular hardware or systems,
however, and it is easy to write programs that will run without change on any machine that supports C.

In our experience, C has proven to be pleasant, expressive, and versatile language for a variety of programs.
It is easy to learn, and
it wears well as one's experience with it grows.

(K&R, 1988)

C is a general-purpose programming language.
It has been closely associated with the UNIX system where it was developed,
since both the system and most of the programs that run on it are written in C.
The language, however, is not tied to any one operating system or machine; 
and although it has been called a "system programming language" because it is useful for
writing compilers and operating systems, it has been used equally well
to write major programs in many different domains.

(K&R, 1988)
```

```
C is a relatively "low level" language.
This characterization is not pejorative;
it simply means that C deals with the same sort of objects that most computers do,
namely characters, numbers, and adresses. These may be combined and moved about with
the arithmetic and logical operators implementedby real machines.

(K&R, 1998)
```

```
Although the absence of some... features may seem like a grave deficiency...
keeping the language down to a modest size has real benefits.
Since C is relatively small, it can be described in a small space, and learned quickly.
A programmer can reasonably expect to know and understand and indeed regularly use the
entire language.

(K&R, 1988)
```

```
Because the data types and control structures provided by C
are supported directly by most computers, the run time library required
to implement self-contained programs is tiny.
The standard library functions are only called explicitly, so they
can be avoided if they are not needed.
Most can be written in C, and except for the operating system detil they conceal,
are themselves portable.

(K&W, 1988)
```

```
Although C matches the capabilities of many computers,
it is independet of any particular machine archtecture.
With a little care it is easy to write portable programs, that is,
programs that can be run without change on a variety of hardware.
The standard makes portability issues explicit, and prescribes
a set of constants that characterize the machine on which the program is run.

(K&W, 1988)
```

```
... Nevertheless, C retains the basic philosophy that
programmers know what are they doing;
it only requires that they state their intentions explicitly.

(K&W, 1988)
```

```
C, like  any other language, has its blemishes...
Nonetheless, C has proven to be an extremely effective and expressive
language for a wide variety of programming applications.

A Talk About How I Program in C

... C is the greatest language, for all the reasons other people hate it.


In the beginning you always want *results*.
In the end all you want is *control*.

(Steenberg, 2016)

```
... a talk about how I program and my style of programming.
This talk is about C programming... kind of advanced C... meant for... who don't program in C.

... programmers from other language probably know superficialy C...
work like all the other languages, except it doesn't have a bunch of stuff
and therefore it's harder and it's evil.

...they don't know how to make something in C. How to build a real application.
That's what I'm going to be talking about.

(Steenberg, 2016)
```

```
... C is the greatest language,
... not a perfect language.

... the reason why that it is a language that is 40+ years old and still have been beaten
because people who design languages...
... assumptions ... trying to solve the wrong problem.

It is not obvious that C does things right.
That's why people
don't try to do something that is better than C,
but try to do something different.

(Steenberg, 2016)
```

```
In the beginning you always want *results*.
In the end all you want is *control*.

True for almost anything you do.

I just want this VS. What can I make today?

... eventually you want to tinkering with everything.
... eventually you ask...
why it doesn't have that feature you think you need,
why it doesn't everything I want.

So, you start out
NOT wanting all those features
and in the end complain that isn't enough features.

And therefore you should know from the beginning...
that there is a bunch of complexity in this,
but I going to want that complexity
... not be afraid... not complain about

... this has reasons and I going to embrace that.

In an environment,
I just want one thing! Why can't this environment make me this thing?
VS.
What do I have in this environment? What can this environment provide me.
If you allow this enviroment show what you can do, find interesting tools...
you can make this way more awesome,
than just make that and don't care how it is made.

Key to good programmer:
want to learn how to do things.

I spend 20min a year looking for memory leaks,
the rest of the world spends all their time trying to avoid garbage collection.
